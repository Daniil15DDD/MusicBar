# ORBT

**Your album cover in the macOS menu bar, with a waveform next to it.**

## Why

macOS shows a plain icon for Now Playing. ORBT shows the **real cover** instead, like the iPhone's Dynamic Island. Click it for a small player.

## On the lock screen

A player card sits above the macOS lock screen: cover, title, seek bar, shuffle / previous / play / next / repeat and a favourite star. Click the small cover for fullscreen: a big cover with a soft colour wash, or, when Apple has made **moving artwork** for the album, the video fills the whole screen.

<br><br><sub>Rendered from the app's own views (the real lock screen shows your wallpaper and a glass blur behind the card).</sub>
</div>

In fullscreen, two buttons in the bottom-right corner open **lyrics** (time-synced, the current line big and bright, tap a line to jump there) or the **queue**. Either button can be hidden in Settings.

## Features

- Real album art and an animated waveform in the menu bar
- Compact player: seek bar, previous / play / next, shuffle, repeat
- **Lock screen player** with a fullscreen mode and Apple's **moving artwork** (when the album has it)
- **Lyrics** and **queue** on the fullscreen lock screen, each with a button you can hide in Settings
- Favourite (star) and equalizer presets for Apple Music; optional Liquid Glass look on the lock screen (macOS 26+)
- Works with **Apple Music** and **Spotify** (Spotify's real queue and a save button need an optional one-time connection, see below)
- Light on resources (about 1% CPU while playing), no Dock icon, no audio recording

## Performance

Built to stay out of the way. Measured with `top` on an Apple Silicon MacBook (macOS 27) while a song was playing, with the popover and lock screen closed:

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/performance.png" width="720" alt="About 1% CPU while playing, under 1% while paused, about 100 MB memory">
</div>

How: the waveform animates on the graphics side, the menu bar uses a small thumbnail of the cover, updates come from Music's own notifications, and the moving-artwork video is only buffered while the Mac is locked (about +25 MB while it plays; the CPU and memory numbers above were not re-measured with it playing). The memory figure was measured with `top` after launch and includes the lock screen windows (about 24 MB of it).

## Install

1. Download the zip from [Releases](https://github.com/Daniil15DDD/ORBT/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Move `ORBT.app` to Applications and right-click → **Open** (it is not notarized).
3. Allow it to control Music and Spotify when macOS asks.

Needs macOS 14.2+. To build it yourself instead: `git clone` this repo, then `./build.sh` (Command Line Tools are enough).

## Good to know

- The waveform is a lively animation, not a real audio analysis, so nothing is listened to. An optional setting makes it react to live audio (macOS then asks for audio-capture permission).
- The equalizer is Apple Music only. Spotify's scripting interface has no like command and no queue, so those use Spotify's Web API, which is optional: create a free Spotify developer app (its owner needs Premium; Spotify limits such apps to 5 users), add the redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1/callback`, paste its Client ID in Settings and log in once. ORBT keeps the token in the Keychain. This is untested against a real Spotify account so far.
- Lyrics come from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net), a free open database: it receives the song title, artist, album and length. Not every song has them.
- The queue shows the next songs of the current Apple Music playlist. With shuffle on, Apple Music doesn't share what plays next, so "Recently played" is shown instead.
- The lock screen player uses undocumented macOS window calls, because Apple offers no official way to draw there. A macOS update could break it. Turn it off in Settings if you prefer.
- Moving artwork is read from Apple's public catalogue pages, which is unofficial. When an album has none, you get the normal cover.
- No song info? Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation.
